## Overview
In this repository, we provide the code for paper: [ECG-Based Heart Arrhythmia Diagnosis Through Attentional Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10226).
The proposed deep learning model: Attention-Based Convolutional Neural Networks (ABCNN) take advantage of CNN and multi-head attention, to work straight on raw ECG data and extract the informative dependencies automatically for accurate arrhythmia detection.

## Code
`ABCNN_ECG.py`: the implementation of the proposed ABCNN model.

## Dataset
Please find the dataset in [MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database Directory](https://www.physionet.org/physiobank/database/html/mitdbdir/mitdbdir.htm).
